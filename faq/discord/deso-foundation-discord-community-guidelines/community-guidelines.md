# Community Guidelines

## Shilling&#x20;

* Sharing external links to projects with little or no context within a conversation between another community member&#x20;
* â€œNative Shilling" - bots create new discord users who start brief conversations about projects (tokens, NFTs, etc.) that appear to be organic (mods can decipher this type of shilling by checking the lifetime of the account and whether the username contributes to other channels regularly)
* Community members are welcome to share his/her project, with the intention to find partners or gather feedback, in the #projects-collabs channel&#x20;

## Warnings Users&#x20;

* Users who partake in [#shilling](community-guidelines.md#shilling "mention") tokens, NFTs, or other projects should be immediately warned by a moderator
* Users who post inappropriate, degrading, or personal attacks will be warned immediately
* If a user receives more than 2 warnings, he/she should be banned from the server&#x20;

## Banning Users&#x20;

* Users who engage in unsolicited direct DMs regarding wallets and transferring money, as well as obvious imposters, should be immediately banned
* Under most circumstances, if a user receives more than 2 warnings, he/she will be banned from the server

## Deleting Content&#x20;

* Inappropriate, degrading, or personal attacks will be deleted immediately&#x20;
* Offensive emojis, stickers, memes, or gifs will be deleted immediately&#x20;
* Content that could be considered [#shilling](community-guidelines.md#shilling "mention") will be deleted immediately&#x20;
