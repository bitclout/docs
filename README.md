# DeSo: The Decentralized Social Network

## Introduction: Why DeSo?

**Today, social media is even more centralized than the financial industry was prior to the creation of Bitcoin.** A handful of private companies effectively control public discourse, and these companies earn monopoly profits off of content that they don't even create. Meanwhile, the creators who actually produce the content are underpaid, under-engaged, and  under-monetized thanks to an outdated ads-driven business model. On top of all of this, the ads-driven business model also forces social media companies to keep a walled garden around their data that prevents external developers from innovating or building apps on top of it.

These problems stem from the fact that the data and content created by users today is privately-owned by a handful of companies, rather than publicly-accessible as an open utility. Because only a handful of companies have access to the content, only these companies can curate competitive feeds, only these companies can build competitive new features and apps, and only these companies can monetize this content-- content that isn't even created by these companies in the first place. We're stuck in a loop: Users have to use these companies' apps because these companies have a monopoly on the content, and because of this, creators are forced into continuing to give their content up to these companies in order to get reach, in a vicious cycle that continues to empower these companies at the expense of creators and society as a whole. These companies have have managed to create a global network effect around a private pool of content that only they can monetize. Moreover, this centralization of content seems unavoidable: There's value in combining all of the content into a single pool, since it allows for curation at a global scale, but whoever we put in charge of the pool is ultimately going to become a gatekeeper like what we have today. A solution would arise if we had a way to shift the network effect to a public pool of content that no individual entity controls, and that anyone in the world can monetize-- but can it be done?

We believe all of these problems can be solved by decentralizing social media in the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralizing the financial system. In particular, Bitcoin created a way to store transactions on a public ledger that no individual entity can monopolize, and we believe this technology can now be extended, for the first time, to store social media content without needing to rely on a centralized gatekeeper. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown that dominant platforms can be built around open code and open data, rather than around private companies that monopolize their data and benefit shareholders at the expense of everyone else. Bitcoin and Ethereum don't have data moats to protect. In fact, the more open they are and the more people that build on top of them, the more value accrues to Bitcoin and Ethereum holders. This open model for software is already disrupting financial institutions all over the world, from banks to exchanges, and we think, for the first time, this model can be extended to disrupt the social media giants and their out-dated ads-driven business models. If we can start putting social media content into a public blockchain, rather than giving it to a handful of private companies to monopolize, we believe we can create an economy of scale around that blockchain that is powerful enough to rival, and ultimately surpass, what the traditional social media giants have created. In some sense, we can solve a collective action problem among independent publishers by making it individually rational for them to contribute their content to a new globally-shared pool that, for the first time, isn't controlled by a single company.

In this paper, we introduce DeSo, short for "decentralized social," the first and only blockchain custom-built from the ground up to power and scale a new category of decentralized social applications to one billion users. While much research has been dedicated to scaling so-called "decentralized finance" or "DeFi" applications, relatively little has been invested in building blockchains that can scale social media applications, even though the latter category is arguably just as large, if not larger, and holds just as much promise for societal benefit. Moreover, while several general-purpose blockchains tout their ability to scale to tens of thousands of transactions per second, we believe none of these blockchains is currently equipped to handle the unique storage and indexing requirements of social media applications. For example, DeFi applications typically require the updating of balance entries in-place, without creating new "state," whereas every post on a social platform  creates state that needs to be stored and indexed in a certain way. To use a more general analogy from the centralized world, the infrastructure that powers Facebook today is vastly different from the infrastructure that powers the New York Stock Exchange-- they have completely different architectures that are tailored to support a particular type of application at massive scale. Similarly, our thesis with DeSo is that a blockchain that can scale decentralized social applications to one billion users will look vastly different than a blockchain that can scale DeFi apps to the same level.









At launch, the DeSo blockchain supports not only traditional social features like creating profiles and posts, but also novel blockchain-native features like social tokens, tipping, and NFTs. These features alone enable vast new categories of money-enabled products, from social NFT experiences to influencer stock markets. These products in turn can allow creators to earn orders of magnitude more money on DeSo-enabled apps than on traditional social networks, while maintaining a more direct relationship with their followers. Moreover, creators aren't locked-in to a handful of centralized apps with DeSo because the business model of DeSo revolves around transactions flowing through a decentralized network of potentially thousands of third-party apps, similar to how Ethereum works today for DeFi applications. We believe this more decentralized business model can come to replace the traditional ads-driven business model for social media, which inherently requires concentrating users into a few highly-centralized apps in order to maximize profit.





But what happens if, instead of giving all of our data up to these companies, we put all of our data into a public, globally-accessible pool? Now, suddenly, anyone can use this content to create a competitive app that challenges these companies. Anybody can curate a feed using the content, so that we get less mono-culture.





In contrast, imagine for a moment if there was a way to have all of the content created by users be public rather than privately-held by these companies. 





Recently, much research has been invested into general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, but relatively little has been invested in vertical-focused blockchains, even though the latter is likely what's required to scale blockchain-based applications to one billion users.



**DeSo is a new type of social network that mixes speculation and social media, and it’s built from the ground up as its own custom blockchain.** Its architecture is similar to Bitcoin, only it can support complex social network data like posts, profiles, follows, speculation features, and much more at significantly higher throughput and scale. Like Bitcoin, DeSo is a fully open-source project and there is no company behind it-- it’s just coins and code.

## Buying DeSo

The DeSo blockchain has its own native cryptocurrency, called DeSo, that you can use to do all kinds of things on the platform, including buy a new type of asset called [“creator coins,” discussed below.](./#what-are-creator-coins)

Anyone can buy the DeSo cryptocurrency with Bitcoin in minutes through the app’s built-in decentralized “atomic swap” mechanism, available on [the “Buy DeSo” page](https://bitclout.com/buy-deso). The supply of DeSo is capped at [approximately 10.8 million](https://bitclout.com/posts/7bf4cfb5a9328c0f42c74454479ce4f889938157ae8208ae9d8120bf5b0f3ffc), roughly half that of Bitcoin, making it naturally scarce.

## What are Creator Coins?

### Everyone Has a Coin

Every profile on the platform gets its own coin that anybody can buy and sell. We call these coins “creator coins,” and you can have your own coin too simply by creating a profile. The price of each coin goes up when people buy and goes down when people sell.

### You Can Buy Your Favorite Person’s Coin

To buy someone’s coin, you simply navigate to their profile and hit “Buy.” You can find someone’s profile either by searching for it or by visiting the creator coin leaderboard \(shown below\). Profiles for the top 15,000 influencers from Twitter have been pre-loaded into the platform, which means you can buy and sell their coins even though they're not on the platform yet. These “reserved” profiles have a “clock” icon next to their names, indicating the owner of the profile has not joined yet.

### Tweet to Claim Your Profile

The owner of a reserved profile can claim their profile by navigating to their profile and hitting a button to Tweet their DeSo public key \(shown below\). When they do this, they gain full access to the account, as well as a percentage of the creator coins associated with their profile \(see [Founder Rewards](./#founder-rewards)\). Only the owner of the Twitter account associated with a reserved profile can claim it.

### What Are Creator Coins Useful For?

Creator coins are a new type of asset class that is tied to the reputation of an individual, rather than to a company or commodity. They are truly the first tool we have as a society to trade “social clout” as an asset. If people understand this, then the value of someone’s coin should be correlated to that person’s standing in society. For example, if Elon Musk succeeds in landing the first person on Mars, his coin price should theoretically go up. And if, in contrast, he makes a racial slur during a press conference, his coin price should theoretically go down. Thus, people who believe in someone’s potential can buy their coin and succeed with them financially when that person realizes their potential. And traders can make money buying and selling the ups and downs.

The above being said, there are many other exciting opportunities for creator coins that we hope will be integrated in the very near future:

#### **The Stakeholder Meeting**

A creator can make it so that only people who own a certain amount of their coin can participate in the comments section of their posts. This forces anyone who wants to have a voice in that creator’s content to first align themselves with the creator by buying their coin. The alignment not only reduces spam significantly, but it could bias conversations to be significantly more positive than on existing platforms. It would also create a lot of demand for one’s coin-- can you imagine if Elon Musk or Chamath did an AMA with a minimum threshold for buying their coin in order to participate? Or if they answered questions in order of coin holdings?

#### Premium Messages

Most creators get a torrent of spam in their message inbox on social media. With DeSo they could make it so that only people who own a certain amount of their coin can message them, or they could simply rank and prioritize messages from the largest holders of their coin. Alternatively, they can make it so that a certain amount of their coin must be paid to them directly in order for the message to actually enter their inbox. All of this would increase demand for their coin while helping to minimize spam for the creator.

#### Sponsored Posts

Creators can have an “inbox” where anyone can “bid” to have them repost \(aka “retweet”\) a particular post. If you want Kim Kardashian to retweet your fashion brand, you can submit an entry into her inbox, and if she retweets it then she keeps your money. The bids can all be made using the creator’s own coin, thus significantly increasing the demand for the coin.

#### Premium Content

People who own a certain amount of a creator’s coin get access to special content. Or, alternatively, people must pay a monthly subscription in the form of the creator’s coin in order to get premium content.

#### Distributions and Engagement

Creators can also use their coins to distribute scarce resources to the largest holders of their coins. For example, imagine if a famous celebrity offered to have lunch with whoever held the most of their coin at a particular date. Or imagine if they were going to offer 1,000 signed posters to their 1,000 largest holders. This is just the beginning of how creators can engage with their fans using their coins, and all such ideas could increase demand for their coin significantly.

#### Money Likes

Likes can be re-imagined as purchases of the creator’s coin. So it costs money to like something, but you get that person’s coin when you do so \(effectively as a shortcut to buying their coin that’s associated directly with their content\). Such a feature could serve as a stronger signal on what content is high quality as well.

#### Emergent Phenomena

What can happen when you give people the ability to speculate on a person’s reputation? We can’t know for sure, but one of the features that has emerged is what we call “buy and retweet.” Ordinarily, retweeting someone gives you nothing. If that person becomes a superstar because you boosted them, you’ll be lucky if they even remember your name in a few years. In contrast, with DeSo you can buy someone’s coin and then retweet them, which makes it so that you’re not only along for the ride financially if they blow up, but you also get bragging rights. Imagine the difference between being able to say “I retweeted her early on” vs being able to say “I bought her coin when it was $0.50 and now it’s $500-- and by the way I’ve done this hundreds of times, and I can prove it because my track record is on the blockchain.” The latter is clearly a very different game. Moreover, it’s not just a famous person’s game. If you know someone with a lot of clout, or if you know someone who knows someone, you can buy a coin and send it to someone else so that they can buy and retweet them. And thus the incentives go many layers deep. The interesting thing about this mechanic is that it wasn’t even something consciously designed into the product. It exists as an “emergent” phenomenon off of the core creator coin mechanic. What other dynamics could exist that we haven’t yet thought of?

### The Creator Coin Supply Curve

Creator coins are naturally scarce, with generally fewer than 100 to 1,500 coins in existence for each profile. This is because as more people buy a profile’s creator coin, the price of the coin goes up automatically at a faster and faster rate. This means that, eventually, it would take billions of dollars to mint even one more coin.

The formula or “curve” for determining the price of a creator’s coin is as follows. Note that creator coins are normally bought and sold with the DeSo cryptocurrency, but we provide a dollar version of the formula for easy calculating:

$$
price\_in\_deso = .003 \times creator\_coins\_in\_circulation^2
\\
price\_in\_usd = .003 \times creator\_coins\_in\_circulation^2 \times bitclout\_price\_in\_usd
$$

When you create a profile, there are initially zero coins in existence and thus the price is zero. If you want to buy coins from the profile, it will happily mint them out of thin air and sell them to you according to the price curve above, making it more and more expensive as more coins are purchased. The money you use to buy the coins gets “locked” in the profile in exchange for the coins. On the flipside, if you want to sell coins, the profile will happily buy them from you according to the curve using the money locked from previous buys. And so buying **creates** coins while pushing the price **up** and **locking** money into the profile, while selling **destroys** coins while pushing the price **down** and **unlocking** money from the profile. This is often referred to as an “automated market-maker,” and it’s the same concept that powers protocols like Uniswap and Bancor.

Below is a graph of what the creator coin price curve looks like as a function of how many creator coins are in circulation for a given profile. We also include a table that shows some of these values. Both of these assume a DeSo price of $16. Note also that “integrating” the price curve yields the amount of money “locked” in a profile, which is equal to the “net” amount of money that has flowed into that particular creator coin \(included as the third column of the table\). If you’d like to play with the numbers yourself, you can do so using [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zBEQBBoS12ZhFpPbB13-GTZ8keDVlstRG3l2If78pWM/edit?usp=sharing) \(make a copy to edit it\). You can also learn more about bonding curves [here](https://yos.io/2018/11/10/bonding-curves).

| **Creator Coins in Circulation** | **Creator Coin Price \(USD\)** | **USD Locked in Profile** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5 | $1.20 | $2 |
| 10 | $4.80 | $16 |
| 20 | $19.20 | $128 |
| 40 | $76.80 | $1,024 |
| 80 | $307.20 | $8,192 |
| 160 | $1,228.80 | $65,536 |
| 320 | $4,915.20 | $524,288 |
| 640 | $19,660.80 | $4,194,304 |
| 1280 | $78,643.20 | $33,554,432 |

### Founder Rewards

Every profile allows the creator to keep a certain percentage of the coins that are created as a “founder reward.” For example, if someone sets their founder reward percentage to 10% and then someone buys 100 DeSo of their coin, then 10 DeSo would be used to buy the creator’s coin, and those coins would go to the creator’s wallet rather than the purchaser’s.

The above being said, we think the better way for creators to own a piece of the upside of their coin is simply to buy their coin up-front when they create their profile, and then set their founder reward percentage to zero. This works because the coins are cheapest at the beginning of the curve, and it has the upshot of reducing friction on subsequent purchases of their coin. Nevertheless, the founder reward percentage being 10% is a “sane default” that guarantees creators will maintain a certain percentage of their coin even if they do nothing.

## The Power of Decentralization

Just like Bitcoin, anyone on the internet can run a DeSo “node” that serves the DeSo content, and every node on the network stores a full copy of all the data. This means that anybody can build apps on top of the DeSo data without the risk of being de-platformed, and they can even create their own feed algorithm. When you visit bitclout.com, you’re using our node, but there are already dozens of nodes on the network, all run by people like you. In the long run there will likely be hundreds or thousands of other nodes you could visit to get access to the same content, each with their own moderation policy. It also means that your login on bitclout.com can be used on any domain that runs a DeSo node. In the same way that you can move Bitcoin from one wallet to another, DeSo makes it so that you can move your “clout” in the form of your followers, posts, creator coin balances, etc anywhere as well. Thus, in some sense, DeSo is decentralizing social media in much the same way as Bitcoin is decentralizing the financial system.
