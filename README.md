# DeSo: The Decentralized Social Network

## Introduction: Why DeSo?

Today, social media is even more centralized than the financial industry was prior to the creation of Bitcoin. A handful of private companies effectively control public discourse, and these companies earn monopoly profits off of content that they don't even create. Meanwhile, the creators who actually produce the content are underpaid, under-engaged, and  under-monetized thanks to an outdated ads-driven business model. On top of all of this, the ads-driven business model also forces social media companies to keep a walled garden around their data that prevents external developers from innovating or building apps on top of it.

These problems stem from the fact that the data and content created by users today is privately-owned by a handful of companies, rather than publicly-accessible as an open utility. Because only a handful of companies have access to the content, only these companies can curate competitive feeds, only these companies can build competitive new features and apps, and only these companies can monetize this content-- content that isn't even created by these companies in the first place. We're stuck in a loop: Users have to use these companies' apps because these companies have a monopoly on the content, and because of this, creators are forced into continuing to give their content up to these companies in order to get reach, in a vicious cycle that continues to empower these companies at the expense of creators and society as a whole. These companies have have managed to create a global network effect around a private pool of content that they solely monopolize. Moreover, this centralization of content seems unavoidable: There's value in combining all of the content into a single pool, since it allows for curation at a global scale, but whoever we put in charge of maintaining the pool is ultimately going to become a gatekeeper like what we have today. A solution would arise if we had a way to shift the network effect to a public pool of content that no individual entity controls-- but can it be done?

We believe all of these problems can be solved by decentralizing social media in the same way Bitcoin and Ethereum are decentralizing the financial system. In particular, Bitcoin created a way to store transactions on a public ledger that no individual entity can monopolize, and we believe this technology can now be extended, for the first time, to store social media content without needing to rely on a centralized gatekeeper. Bitcoin and Ethereum have shown that dominant platforms can be built around open code and open data, rather than around private companies that monopolize their data and benefit shareholders at the expense of everyone else. Bitcoin and Ethereum don't have data moats to protect. In fact, the more open they are and the more people that build on top of them, the more value accrues to Bitcoin and Ethereum holders. This open model for software is already disrupting financial institutions all over the world, from banks to exchanges, and we think, for the first time, this model can be extended to disrupt the social media giants and their out-dated ads-driven business models. If we can start putting social media content into a public blockchain, rather than giving it to a handful of private companies to monopolize, we believe we can create an economy of scale around that blockchain that is powerful enough to rival, and ultimately surpass, what the traditional social media giants have created. In some sense, we can solve a collective action problem among independent publishers by making it individually rational for them to contribute their content to a new globally-shared pool that they can never be di-intermediated from and that, for the first time, isn't controlled by a single company.

In this paper, we introduce DeSo, short for "decentralized social," the first and only blockchain custom-built from the ground up to power and scale a new category of decentralized social applications to one billion users. While much research has been dedicated to scaling so-called "decentralized finance" or "DeFi" applications, relatively little has been invested in building blockchains that can scale social media applications, even though the latter category is arguably just as large, if not larger, and holds just as much promise for value creation. Moreover, while several general-purpose blockchains tout their ability to scale to tens of thousands of transactions per second, we believe none of these blockchains is currently equipped to handle the unique storage and indexing requirements of social media applications. For example, DeFi applications typically require the updating of balance entries in-place, without creating new "state," whereas every post on a social platform  creates new state that needs to be stored and indexed in a certain way. To use a more general analogy from the centralized world, the infrastructure that powers Facebook today is vastly different from the infrastructure that powers the New York Stock Exchange-- they have completely different architectures that are tailored to support a particular type of application at massive scale. Similarly, our thesis with DeSo is that a blockchain that can scale decentralized social applications to one billion users will likely look vastly different than a blockchain that can scale DeFi apps to the same level. Thus, we believe the future of crypto does not consist of a single general-purpose blockchain that rules them all, but rather a series of dominant blockchains, each tailored to a particular category of application.

## The Ultimate Vision

Today, a post submitted to Instram, TikTok, or Twitter belongs to these corporations, rather than the creator who posted it. And the monetization goes predominantly to these corporations as a result.

In contrast, DeSo stores all of its data on a public blockchain, which means that anyone in the world can run a node that exposes their own curated feed. Today, bitclout.com operates one such node, but there are [over 100 other projects](http://bithunt.com/explore) running nodes and building apps on DeSo as well. Moreover, there is no reason why other "verticalized" players can't enter the market to create feeds that they're uniquely suited toward curating. For example, imagine if ESPN ran a node that curated a feed of the best sports content. Or if Politico ran a node that curated a feed of the best political content. Additionally, since DeSo is fully open-source, these players could even customize their UI and build custom algorithms to rank the influencers and posts in a way that serves their specific target customer. We think this will quickly move us from a world in which a handful of juggernauts control the dominant feeds to one in which consumers will have thousands of feeds to choose from, each with its own specific focus.

On top of that, storing all of the data on a public blockchain makes it so that, with one engineer, anyone can build a social media experience that's competitive with the existing incumbents. It cannot be overstated the extent to which this lowers the barrier to entry for creating new social media products. It becomes possible for existing publishers to trivially spin up social apps and experiences as direct adjacencies to their core business, and allows upstarts to innovate on a relatively even footing with megacorps for the first time. Compare this to today where building a competitive social app generally requires building a billion-user data moat first.

The best part is that anyone who runs a node to curate their own feed also contributes data back to the public pool of profiles, posts, follows, etc... that's stored on the public blockchain. A post or a like on ESPN's node can be surfaced on Politico's feed. A post made in China can be surfaced on a feed running on a node in America and vice versa. And with every node that runs, more content gets contributed back to the global data pool stored on the blockchain, making every other node on the network more powerful and more engaging to users. In some sense, DeSo can solve a collective action problem among independent publishers: Instead of being forced to contribute to a privately-owned data pool controlled by a megacorp who's not aligned with them, publishers can now contribute to a public data pool that nobody controls and that they'll never be dis-intermediated from. Thus we can move from a world in which data is a heavily-guarded, privately-owned resource to one in which it is more like a globally-accessible utility that anyone can build on.

* Importantly, there is a strong incentive for publishers to contribute data back to the blockchain because not doing so would deter the top creators from wanting to publish on them. After all, why would you publish solely on a closed platform that exclusively owns your data when you could additionally publish to the blockchain and have your post instantly available to every node/feed that's running on the internet?

We think all of the above can give the creators unprecedented reach, and a more direct relationship with their followers than has been afforded to them with existing platforms. But reach is only one side of the coin-- the other side is monetization.

Social tokens, social NFTs, and social tipping, three categories of product pioneered by DeSo, are already changing the game in terms of how creators monetize on the internet, but they're only the beginning. Because DeSo is money-native and open-source, anyone in the world can start to experiment with new ways for creators to monetize by building an app on top of DeSo. For example, imagine a major creator wants to start offering premium content in exchange for a monthly subscription. All it takes is for one person on the internet to build this feature, and the entire ecosystem of DeSo applications gets access to it instantly. The same goes for other features like an inbox where creators can be paid to repost content, or paid to answer messages from their followers. And this goes for other things like detecting harmful content or weeding out spam, where the best machine learning researchers in the world can build solutions, with access to the full firehose of data, without asking for permission, no matter where they are. The DeSo blockchain is fundamentally an open protocol that the entire world can build on collaboratively, which we believe will ultimately create even more ways to unlock creators' true potential, and bring competition and innovation back to social media.

Moreover, because DeSo is money-native, new signals emerge that can be used to rank content more effectively. For example, the first experiment that was launched by the BitClout app was ranking comments by the coin price of the commenter. Amazingly, this extremely simple ranking mechanism has already produced results that we think are competitive with centralized platforms. Ranking messages by coin price has also significantly reduced spam spam for influencers in a way that's truly unique to DeSo apps, and this is still just the beginning. Imagine what else will be built off of the "$DESO Signal" once the entire world starts building on and contributing to DeSo.

Finally, we think it's important to mention that we designed DeSo from the ground up so that the incentives of the system keep it decentralized, even in the long run. Creators have a strong incentive to post directly to the blockchain, rather than to a centralized app that withholds their content from the blockchain. And there's virtually no possibility for developers lose access to data or API's because all the data is on the blockchain, and they already have all the data when they run a node. Compare this to traditional social media companies, which start open to build a network effect and then shut off access after they've built a winning data moat.

With your help, we hope to build the DeSo blockchain into an enduring positive force for humanity that can bring competition and innovation back to the internet. The internet started as a fundamentally decentralized ecosystem, but we’re at a point in history where things have concentrated and where innovating is harder than it used to be. After much thought over the past several years, we are convinced that the pendulum will swing back toward decentralization, perhaps permanently, and we all have an opportunity to be a part of that. A new generation of applications that the entire world can build collaboratively, unlocking the full potential of human ingenuity.

## How Does DeSo Work?

### The Problem With General-Purpose Blockchains

While traditional blockchains like Ethereum are very good for creating open ecosystems, we believe they won't scale to handle the requirements of competitive social media applications. In particular, we see social media as a special use-case that needs to be unbundled in order to be properly served.

The biggest problems are storage and indexing. For example, the cost to store just one megabyte on Ethereum today is [approximately $338,654](https://justpaste.it/1oa4o)! Even with four orders of magnitude of improvement on this, the cost would still be ~$33 to upload a relatively small image. On top of that, because traditional blockchains aren't set up to index the data you store on them, there is no way to easily query this data.

This means that general-purpose blockchains will generally always require highly-centralized components in order to serve social use-cases, mitigating the benefits of an open data ecosystem in the first place. After all, if all the posts are stored on a single entity's centralized server then nothing stops the operator of that server from becoming the new gatekeeper.

### The Advantages of Bare Metal

DeSo's biggest advantage lies in the fact that it is, in fact, _not_ a general-purpose blockchain. Instead, it supports a narrow set of social-oriented features that it implements on bare metal, using custom indexes that every node builds during consensus when it syncs from its peers. In contrast, general-purpose blockchains must run all functions through a virtual machine, which is typically orders of magnitude slower than running on bare metal, and even then they cannot build custom indexes for querying as they sync.

As a simple example, consider displaying a simple list of a user's most recent posts. Because general-purpose blockchains do not generally support ordered lists, this is not even possible without building an off-chain index. In contrast, DeSo natively supports indexes such as posts ordered by timestamp, profiles ordered by the value of their coin, NFT bids organized by which NFT they're associated with, and much more, and all of these indexes can scale as the user-base grows. This significantly reduces the complexity of running a node, which in turn can significantly increase the decentralization of the ecosystem, and the number of apps that can be built on top of DeSo.

As another very simple example, consider a transaction that updates one's username. A node needs to check that the username is not currently held by another user before it allows this transaction to go through. Simple, right? Except that when you have just a few thousand users, this lookup becomes prohibitively expensive on even the most advanced general-purpose blockchains today because of the overhead of their virtual machine, and the overhead in how they implement large key-value maps. In contrast, because DeSo can support this lookup with access to bare metal, it can cheaply and efficiently create a simple key-value index that is as fast as can possibly be, and that can even be sharded across multiple disks or nodes as the user-base grows. The advantages of bare metal only increase as more use-cases are supported, such as checking that a parent post exists before allowing someone to reply, or even checking that an NFT is for sale before allowing someone to place a bid \(noting that Ethereum's lack of support for on-chain bidding has caused significant centralization and concentration to occur around NFT marketplaces\).

### The Importance of Storing Everything On-Chain

Some would argue that social applications can get by without storing everything on-chain. For example, one could imagine an Ethereum-based app that registers a user's public key on the blockchain initially, but then stores all posts on a centralized server. The problem with such an app is that whoever is running the centralized server has significant incentive to, eventually, become a gatekeeper just like the social juggernauts we have today. This is especially true if the app is structured as a for-profit company, as it most likely would be, since its fiduciary duty to its shareholders will inevitably accelerate its transformation into a closed walled garden of content.

Thus, with DeSo, we believe it is tantamount to store every piece of data we possibly can on the blockchain, and to adjust the architecture of the chain by whatever means necessary to maintain this

## Running a Node

Running a node gives you full access to the DeSo firehose. Access to every profile, post, follow, creator coin trade, etc... But what can you do with all this power?

### **Running your own feed**

When you run a node, it starts with a blank global feed and an "Admin" panel that you can use to start adding posts to it. **All of the same tools that the bitclout.com team uses to manage their global feed are now available to you to manage a feed of your own.**

Essentially, running a BitClout node allows you to expose your own "view" of the firehose of content. Our bitclout.com node exposes all of the crypto-related content, but when you run your own node you have full control to surface whatever content speaks to you. What will you do with your feed? Here are some ideas for feeds that we think would be popular:

* **A feed for every country and every language.** Isn't it weird that people all over the world consume information curated predominantly by the US? How much does an engineer working in Silicon Valley really know about what people in other countries want to see, or what features they want? In the past, we were stuck with this model because US companies built a data network effect that entrenched them, even in non-US countries. But BitClout can break this status quo because all of its data is open and the barrier to entry to starting a competitive feed is virtually zero. For the first time, people who actually live in a country can curate a feed for their people, no matter how large or small their country is. And this applies to every country that succumbed too quickly to the network effects of the Silicon Valley tech companies. By lowering the barrier to entry to creating a feed, and opening up the data firehose to anyone, we think BitClout has the potential to bring international social media products to a whole new level.
* **The politics-focused feed.** bitclout.com doesn't prioritize political content, but someone should. Imagine a feed where all the posts from the top political figures are highlighted. You could even imagine segmenting the firehose into two feeds: a "red" feed and a "blue" feed that's dedicated to each political party.
* **The sports-focused feed.** Wouldn't it make sense for someone to operate a feed that just highlights all of the best sports content from the best sports influencers? So many people are interested in this content, and we think it deserves its own feed.
* **The NSFW feed.** bitclout.com doesn't prioritize NSFW content in its feed because its user-base is too mainstream. This bias against NSFW content is even stronger with incumbent social media companies. Yet there are so many talented adult influencers on BitClout, with thousands of followers, who are posting every day. It's about time they had their own feed dedicated to them.

We're just scratching the surface here-- it's now up to you, the community, to figure out how best to display the BitClout firehose. Reddit pioneered the concept of a "Subreddit," but the problem with a Subreddit is that every time one is created, it has to solve a "chicken and egg" problem with regard to its content. If nobody is posting, then the subreddit has no content-- but without content, nobody will start posting. BitClout bascially takes the subreddit concept to the next level by solving the "content" part of the equation for everyone. When you run a node, you don't need to bootstrap content because you have full access to the BitClout firehose. All you need to do is curate it in some interesting way and you'll have created value for anyone who visits your node.

### Add social to your platform

Suppose you're a platform with millions of users like Coinbase or Robinhood, or even traditional media companies like ESPN. Your users would probably love it if you could integrate a social component into your products-- but you can't because Twitter and Facebook don't allow it. They [closed down their API's](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/16/17699626/twitter-third-party-apps-streaming-api-deprecation&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1618805849171000&usg=AOvVaw3zPqxFdHzfISpMoiBG_Yi0) a long time ago because they realized that third-party integrations eat into their ad revenue. Every user who engages on a third-party platform is a user who's engaging less on Twitter and Facebook.

Enter BitClout. With BitClout, you don't need to build a billion-user data moat in order to be able to add social features to your platform. All you need to do is run a BitClout node, and use its API to expose whatever content you want. Suddenly, with just one engineer's worth of effort, any major platform can spin up a social product that's adjacent to its core business. Moreover, it's possible that the best feeds will come from existing publishers that have already built a competency in a particular area. For example, ESPN might be the best entity to run the sports-focused feed because of their relationships and connections, and now they can.

### Analysis tools

Building the best analysis tools requires access to the best data, and running a node is the best way to get full access to the BitClout firehose. Until now, the bitclout.com nodes have had to set up rate limits to avoid having our machines get overloaded. But now, because BitClout is a blockchain that allows anyone to run a full copy of the platform, anyone who wants to build analytics tools can simply run a node and query it in whatever way they want.

### Invent your own features

When you run a node, you have the flexibility to expose the BitClout content in whatever way most resonates with your users. If you wanted to, you could even build a whole new frontend with totally different features than what the "default" node gives you. If you feel like BitClout is missing a feature, like dark mode or paid messages or better filtering for spam for example, now you can build it and run your own node to back it.

### Making Money on Your Node

Incentives are key to making BitClout truly decentralized in the long run. It's not sufficient that nodes be runnable by the community, they must be _profitable_ to run as well. Many cryptocurrencies struggle with this, and even Bitcoin and Ethereum nodes are still largely run by volunteers. BitClout is truly unique in this regard, however, because the social features it introduces give node operators incentives that other blockchains don't have.

The above being said, there are several ways that BitClout node operators can earn a profit:

* **Promoted content.** Because running a node comes with the ability to have a social media product with minimal marginal effort, every node operator has an opportunity to amass and monetize the reach that comes from curating a popular feed. This can be as simple as showing promoted posts that partners pay the node operator to pin to their feed.
* **Trading fees.** Anyone who runs a node can modify their frontend to add trading fees on every creator coin trade, which go to the node operator's wallet. By doing this, any node operator basically doubles as a crypto exchange.
* **Other transaction fees.** Any transaction users complete on one's node can be augmented to contain a small fee that goes to the node operator. Thus there should eventually arise an efficient market for node operator fees that is high enough to justify operating a node.

The above mechanisms don't even factor in profits that could be derived from augmenting the BitClout feature set. For example, if someone creates an app experience for BitClout that is significantly better than alternatives, they could even charge a monthly subscription fee or some other premium to cover costs.

### How to Run a Node

Running a node currently requires a modest amount of technical know-how. For the full instructions on how to run a node, check out this GitHub repository:

* [https://github.com/bitclout/run](https://github.com/bitclout/run)

Once a node is running, it syncs all of the blocks from its peers, as well as the transactions in the "mempool," which have yet to be mined into a block. Every node comes with an Admin panel with a Network tab that allows you to monitor the node's sync state.

Once your node is synced, you have access to the full firehose of BitClout data in real time! Below are some tips on how take full advantage of your node.

* Go to your Admin tab and watch the unfiltered feed update as your node syncs. It's like a time machine!
* Try to whitelist some posts in the Admin tab and see that they've made their way onto your global feed.
* Read through the flags available in the [dev.env](https://github.com/bitclout/run/blob/main/dev.env) file. You can adjust these flags however you want, but note that we strongly recommend keeping your node in read-only mode for now. Turning read-only mode off could cause users who visit your node to make transactions that are not ultimately confirmed.
* Set `ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEYS` to your public key so that the Admin tab is only visible to your username.
* Set `SUPER_ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEYS` to your public key so that the Super Admin tab is only visible to your username.
* Whitelist some posts and verify that they show up on the global feed.
* Deploy your node on any cloud provider with a static IP to make it accessible to anyone on the internet.
* Set a `PASSWORDS_FILE` if you want to restrict read access to your node.
* Add an `SSL_CERT_DIR` and `SSL_DOMAIN` using a letsencrypt cert in order to protect your node with HTTPS.
* Set the `TWILIO*` flags to allow new users to get some starter BitClout.
* Set a `SUPPORT_EMAIL` so your users can contact you if they run into trouble.
* Play with the logging verbosity by increasing `GLOG_V`.

### Managing Your Feed

To manage your feed, start by navigating to the Admin tab as shown below. The Admin tab shows the full firehose of posts in real time, with a button next to each one that allows you to add it to the global feed. You can also sort the posts by clout. These are all the same tools that the bitclout.com mods have, now at your fingertips through the power of decentralization.

You can also add any post from anyone's profile to the global feed simply by hitting the dropdown at the top-right of the post. You can also pin posts to your feed, which is a good way of communicating announcements to your user-base.

When you run a node, you act as a moderator and have a variety of superpowers that help you manage spam and harmful content.

* **Blacklisting** a profile removes it everywhere except from peoples' wallet pages. This makes it so that anyone who was holding the blacklisted profile can sell out of their holdings.
* **Graylisting** a profile removes it from the leaderboard, removes it from search, removes its comments from threads, and removes its posts from the Admin panel.
* **Whitelisting** a profile makes that user's posts show up on the global feed automatically with some frequency \(currently it allows five posts per day\).
* Finally, a mod can allow a phone number to be re-used to claim starter BitClout. This is useful for various testing situations.

When you've set your public key as an `ADMIN_PUBLIC_KEY`, the Admin tab becomes visible only to you. This is a critical step in securing your node. Not doing this would make it so that all your users can add posts to the global feed.

### Super Admin Public Keys

Within the Admin Panel, there is a `Super` tab which is only accessible by Super Admins. Super Admin can manage user verification and $CLOUT purchasing behavior from the `Super` tab.

#### Username Verification

Super Admins can grant verification badges \(on their node\) to a user by putting the username in the `Grant Verification Badge` input box and then clicking `Verify`. Similarly, a Super Admin can revoke verification by putting the username in the `Remove Verification Badge` and then clicking `Remove`.

#### Buy $CLOUT Management

Any node can sell $CLOUT if they set the following flags appropriately. Super Admins can set two values in the `Super` tab to manage the price at which $CLOUT is sold on their node: `USD-to-BitClout Reserve Price`and `Buy BitClout Fee Rate`.

**USD-to-BitClout Reserve Price**

This is the minimum price at which you are willing to sell $CLOUT on your node. If the price retrieved from exchange APIs is lower than this amount, your node will sell $CLOUT at this reserve price instead of the API price. Additionally, the price in the right sidebar will appear the reserve price in the event that the price from the API dips below the reserve price.

**Buy BitClout Fee Rate**

This is a percentage-based fee applied to all $CLOUT purchased on your node. If the current price of $CLOUT in USD is $100 and the `Buy BitClout Fee Rate` is 5%, the buyer will pay $105 per $CLOUT and the node operator has earned $5 net. For more details on configuring your node to sell $CLOUT, please read the section titled `Sell $CLOUT on your node`.

### Sell $CLOUT on your node

To simplify the on-boarding experience for new users on your node, you can sell $CLOUT for Bitcoin directly to users. To configure your node to sell $CLOUT, please set the following flags:

* `BUY_BITCLOUT_SEED`: This is a seed phrase for the public key that contains $CLOUT that you will sell to users.  As with all seed phrases, keep this secret and share it with nobody. Take extra precautions to not commit it to version control and quickly move funds if this seed is ever compromised.
  * You will need to deposit $CLOUT to the public key for this seed phrase.  All $CLOUT purchases on your node will send $CLOUT from this wallet.
* `BUY_BITCLOUT_BTC_ADDRESS`: This is a Bitcoin address you control. When users purchased $CLOUT with Bitcoin, the Bitcoin will arrive at this address. 

### How Users Login

When a user logs in on your node, they have the ability to sign in with their BitClout identity, without having to re-enter their seed phrase. Once a user signs in, your node can sign transactions on their behalf with varying levels of approval required depending on what kind of permission the user granted. This creates a login mechanism for node operators that is as easy for users as "login with Facebook," but it unlocks a wallet in addition to a user's identity.

### Node FAQ

Answers to common questions and issues about running your own node:

#### What are the minimum requirements for syncing a node?

We recommend having a machine with at least 32GB of RAM and 350GB of storage \(as at 21 July 2021\). If TXIndex is disabled, then you need about 200GB in total. The Blockchain DB takes up about 90 GB, and the TXIndex takes up 160 GB. THe DB+TXindex size grows by about 50GB a month currently.

#### How do I configure SSL?

There is an example SSL configuration in `nginx.dev`.

#### How do I use the BlockCypher API?

BlockCypher will help prevent double-spends in the mempool. You can signup for a [BlockCypher](https://www.blockcypher.com/) account on the BlockCypher website. BlockCypher does offer a free amount of API calls.

Once you have signed up for an account you may copy a token from the [tokens](https://accounts.blockcypher.com/tokens) section of the dashboard.

You will copy this token in your `dev.env` file as the value for `BLOCK_CYPHER_API_KEY`.

#### What type of records do I use with custom domains?

You must create two seperate **A** type domain records.

Both records should point to the IP address of your node.

**Example DNS Records:**

| Hostname | Type | TTL | Priority | Content |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| node.`DOMAIN`.com | A | 299 |  | `IPADDRESS` |
| api.`DOMAIN`.com | A | 299 |  | `IPADDRESS` |

If you do not create both records you will be unable to use a custom domain.

#### Can my node write back to the mainnet?

Yes! Every transaction is broadcast to all other nodes on the network, and should eventually be mined into a block.

#### What does Twilio provide to my node?

Twilio provides an SMS API that allows you to confirm user phone numbers and thus send them currency from your seed wallet set inside the `dev.env` file. If you do not have this set users will be unable to verify a phone number.

Twilio pricing can be reviewed [here](https://www.twilio.com/sms/pricing/us).

## Blockchain-Native Social Features

At launch, the DeSo blockchain supports not only traditional social features like creating profiles and posts, but also novel blockchain-native features like social tokens, tipping, and NFTs. These features alone enable vast new categories of money-enabled products, from social NFT experiences to influencer stock markets. These products in turn can allow creators to earn orders of magnitude more money on DeSo-enabled apps than on traditional social networks, while maintaining a more direct relationship with their followers. Moreover, creators aren't locked-in to a handful of centralized apps with DeSo because the business model of DeSo revolves around transactions flowing through a decentralized network of potentially thousands of third-party apps, similar to how Ethereum works today for DeFi applications. We believe this more decentralized business model can come to replace the traditional ads-driven business model for social media, which inherently requires concentrating users into a few highly-centralized apps in order to maximize profit.





But what happens if, instead of giving all of our data up to these companies, we put all of our data into a public, globally-accessible pool? Now, suddenly, anyone can use this content to create a competitive app that challenges these companies. Anybody can curate a feed using the content, so that we get less mono-culture.





In contrast, imagine for a moment if there was a way to have all of the content created by users be public rather than privately-held by these companies. 





Recently, much research has been invested into general-purpose blockchains like Ethereum or Solana, but relatively little has been invested in vertical-focused blockchains, even though the latter is likely what's required to scale blockchain-based applications to one billion users.



**DeSo is a new type of social network that mixes speculation and social media, and it’s built from the ground up as its own custom blockchain.** Its architecture is similar to Bitcoin, only it can support complex social network data like posts, profiles, follows, speculation features, and much more at significantly higher throughput and scale. Like Bitcoin, DeSo is a fully open-source project and there is no company behind it-- it’s just coins and code.

## Buying DeSo

The DeSo blockchain has its own native cryptocurrency, called DeSo, that you can use to do all kinds of things on the platform, including buy a new type of asset called [“creator coins,” discussed below.](./#what-are-creator-coins)

Anyone can buy the DeSo cryptocurrency with Bitcoin in minutes through the app’s built-in decentralized “atomic swap” mechanism, available on [the “Buy DeSo” page](https://bitclout.com/buy-deso). The supply of DeSo is capped at [approximately 10.8 million](https://bitclout.com/posts/7bf4cfb5a9328c0f42c74454479ce4f889938157ae8208ae9d8120bf5b0f3ffc), roughly half that of Bitcoin, making it naturally scarce.

## What are Creator Coins?

### Everyone Has a Coin

Every profile on the platform gets its own coin that anybody can buy and sell. We call these coins “creator coins,” and you can have your own coin too simply by creating a profile. The price of each coin goes up when people buy and goes down when people sell.

### You Can Buy Your Favorite Person’s Coin

To buy someone’s coin, you simply navigate to their profile and hit “Buy.” You can find someone’s profile either by searching for it or by visiting the creator coin leaderboard \(shown below\). Profiles for the top 15,000 influencers from Twitter have been pre-loaded into the platform, which means you can buy and sell their coins even though they're not on the platform yet. These “reserved” profiles have a “clock” icon next to their names, indicating the owner of the profile has not joined yet.

### Tweet to Claim Your Profile

The owner of a reserved profile can claim their profile by navigating to their profile and hitting a button to Tweet their DeSo public key \(shown below\). When they do this, they gain full access to the account, as well as a percentage of the creator coins associated with their profile \(see [Founder Rewards](./#founder-rewards)\). Only the owner of the Twitter account associated with a reserved profile can claim it.

### What Are Creator Coins Useful For?

Creator coins are a new type of asset class that is tied to the reputation of an individual, rather than to a company or commodity. They are truly the first tool we have as a society to trade “social clout” as an asset. If people understand this, then the value of someone’s coin should be correlated to that person’s standing in society. For example, if Elon Musk succeeds in landing the first person on Mars, his coin price should theoretically go up. And if, in contrast, he makes a racial slur during a press conference, his coin price should theoretically go down. Thus, people who believe in someone’s potential can buy their coin and succeed with them financially when that person realizes their potential. And traders can make money buying and selling the ups and downs.

The above being said, there are many other exciting opportunities for creator coins that we hope will be integrated in the very near future:

#### **The Stakeholder Meeting**

A creator can make it so that only people who own a certain amount of their coin can participate in the comments section of their posts. This forces anyone who wants to have a voice in that creator’s content to first align themselves with the creator by buying their coin. The alignment not only reduces spam significantly, but it could bias conversations to be significantly more positive than on existing platforms. It would also create a lot of demand for one’s coin-- can you imagine if Elon Musk or Chamath did an AMA with a minimum threshold for buying their coin in order to participate? Or if they answered questions in order of coin holdings?

#### Premium Messages

Most creators get a torrent of spam in their message inbox on social media. With DeSo they could make it so that only people who own a certain amount of their coin can message them, or they could simply rank and prioritize messages from the largest holders of their coin. Alternatively, they can make it so that a certain amount of their coin must be paid to them directly in order for the message to actually enter their inbox. All of this would increase demand for their coin while helping to minimize spam for the creator.

#### Sponsored Posts

Creators can have an “inbox” where anyone can “bid” to have them repost \(aka “retweet”\) a particular post. If you want Kim Kardashian to retweet your fashion brand, you can submit an entry into her inbox, and if she retweets it then she keeps your money. The bids can all be made using the creator’s own coin, thus significantly increasing the demand for the coin.

#### Premium Content

People who own a certain amount of a creator’s coin get access to special content. Or, alternatively, people must pay a monthly subscription in the form of the creator’s coin in order to get premium content.

#### Distributions and Engagement

Creators can also use their coins to distribute scarce resources to the largest holders of their coins. For example, imagine if a famous celebrity offered to have lunch with whoever held the most of their coin at a particular date. Or imagine if they were going to offer 1,000 signed posters to their 1,000 largest holders. This is just the beginning of how creators can engage with their fans using their coins, and all such ideas could increase demand for their coin significantly.

#### Money Likes

Likes can be re-imagined as purchases of the creator’s coin. So it costs money to like something, but you get that person’s coin when you do so \(effectively as a shortcut to buying their coin that’s associated directly with their content\). Such a feature could serve as a stronger signal on what content is high quality as well.

#### Emergent Phenomena

What can happen when you give people the ability to speculate on a person’s reputation? We can’t know for sure, but one of the features that has emerged is what we call “buy and retweet.” Ordinarily, retweeting someone gives you nothing. If that person becomes a superstar because you boosted them, you’ll be lucky if they even remember your name in a few years. In contrast, with DeSo you can buy someone’s coin and then retweet them, which makes it so that you’re not only along for the ride financially if they blow up, but you also get bragging rights. Imagine the difference between being able to say “I retweeted her early on” vs being able to say “I bought her coin when it was $0.50 and now it’s $500-- and by the way I’ve done this hundreds of times, and I can prove it because my track record is on the blockchain.” The latter is clearly a very different game. Moreover, it’s not just a famous person’s game. If you know someone with a lot of clout, or if you know someone who knows someone, you can buy a coin and send it to someone else so that they can buy and retweet them. And thus the incentives go many layers deep. The interesting thing about this mechanic is that it wasn’t even something consciously designed into the product. It exists as an “emergent” phenomenon off of the core creator coin mechanic. What other dynamics could exist that we haven’t yet thought of?

### The Creator Coin Supply Curve

Creator coins are naturally scarce, with generally fewer than 100 to 1,500 coins in existence for each profile. This is because as more people buy a profile’s creator coin, the price of the coin goes up automatically at a faster and faster rate. This means that, eventually, it would take billions of dollars to mint even one more coin.

The formula or “curve” for determining the price of a creator’s coin is as follows. Note that creator coins are normally bought and sold with the DeSo cryptocurrency, but we provide a dollar version of the formula for easy calculating:

$$
price\_in\_deso = .003 \times creator\_coins\_in\_circulation^2
\\
price\_in\_usd = .003 \times creator\_coins\_in\_circulation^2 \times bitclout\_price\_in\_usd
$$

When you create a profile, there are initially zero coins in existence and thus the price is zero. If you want to buy coins from the profile, it will happily mint them out of thin air and sell them to you according to the price curve above, making it more and more expensive as more coins are purchased. The money you use to buy the coins gets “locked” in the profile in exchange for the coins. On the flipside, if you want to sell coins, the profile will happily buy them from you according to the curve using the money locked from previous buys. And so buying **creates** coins while pushing the price **up** and **locking** money into the profile, while selling **destroys** coins while pushing the price **down** and **unlocking** money from the profile. This is often referred to as an “automated market-maker,” and it’s the same concept that powers protocols like Uniswap and Bancor.

Below is a graph of what the creator coin price curve looks like as a function of how many creator coins are in circulation for a given profile. We also include a table that shows some of these values. Both of these assume a DeSo price of $16. Note also that “integrating” the price curve yields the amount of money “locked” in a profile, which is equal to the “net” amount of money that has flowed into that particular creator coin \(included as the third column of the table\). If you’d like to play with the numbers yourself, you can do so using [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zBEQBBoS12ZhFpPbB13-GTZ8keDVlstRG3l2If78pWM/edit?usp=sharing) \(make a copy to edit it\).

| **Creator Coins in Circulation** | **Creator Coin Price \(USD\)** | **USD Locked in Profile** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 5 | $1.20 | $2 |
| 10 | $4.80 | $16 |
| 20 | $19.20 | $128 |
| 40 | $76.80 | $1,024 |
| 80 | $307.20 | $8,192 |
| 160 | $1,228.80 | $65,536 |
| 320 | $4,915.20 | $524,288 |
| 640 | $19,660.80 | $4,194,304 |
| 1280 | $78,643.20 | $33,554,432 |

### Founder Rewards

Every profile allows the creator to keep a certain percentage of the coins that are created as a “founder reward.” For example, if someone sets their founder reward percentage to 10% and then someone buys 100 DeSo of their coin, then 10 DeSo would be used to buy the creator’s coin, and those coins would go to the creator’s wallet rather than the purchaser’s.

The above being said, we think the better way for creators to own a piece of the upside of their coin is simply to buy their coin up-front when they create their profile, and then set their founder reward percentage to zero. This works because the coins are cheapest at the beginning of the curve, and it has the upshot of reducing friction on subsequent purchases of their coin. Nevertheless, the founder reward percentage being 10% is a “sane default” that guarantees creators will maintain a certain percentage of their coin even if they do nothing.

## The Power of Decentralization

Just like Bitcoin, anyone on the internet can run a DeSo “node” that serves the DeSo content, and every node on the network stores a full copy of all the data. This means that anybody can build apps on top of the DeSo data without the risk of being de-platformed, and they can even create their own feed algorithm. When you visit bitclout.com, you’re using our node, but there are already dozens of nodes on the network, all run by people like you. In the long run there will likely be hundreds or thousands of other nodes you could visit to get access to the same content, each with their own moderation policy. It also means that your login on bitclout.com can be used on any domain that runs a DeSo node. In the same way that you can move Bitcoin from one wallet to another, DeSo makes it so that you can move your “clout” in the form of your followers, posts, creator coin balances, etc anywhere as well. Thus, in some sense, DeSo is decentralizing social media in much the same way as Bitcoin is decentralizing the financial system.
