# Window API

## Introduction

This guide describes the Window API, which is an essential component of integrating with the DeSo Identity Service. If you haven't yet read through the [identity.md](../identity.md "mention") and [concepts.md](../concepts.md "mention") guides, it would be helpful to do so prior to reading this documentation. The Window API guide consists of two subpages, which should give you a comprehensive view of the API:

* [basics.md](basics.md "mention") guide outlines the fundamentals of integrating with the Window API
* [endpoints.md](endpoints.md "mention") is an exhaustive list of all API endpoints.

Upon finishing reading about the Window API, we recommend taking a look at the [iframe-api](../iframe-api/ "mention"), especially if you're developing a web application. And if you're creating a mobile app, check out our [mobile-integration.md](../mobile-integration.md "mention") guide next.
