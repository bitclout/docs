# Getting Help from the Community

Up-front, if you ever run into trouble and want to talk to someone, the [DeSo PoS Discussion Telegram Channel](https://t.me/deso_pos_discussion) is a great resource. Everyone who runs a node is in there, as well as members of the DeSo core team. Many there are generally very knowledgeable on the ins and outs of the DeSo blockchain, and super helpful to new users trying to understand what’s going on. We used to run a Discord, but we’ve found a simple dev-focused Telegram channel works better.

If you ever run into issues while doing a swap, the [HeroSwap Support](https://t.me/heroswap) channel can help you. This shouldn’t be needed but we include it here for completeness.
