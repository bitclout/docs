# Social AI Agents

Use the [DeSo Python SDK](https://github.com/deso-protocol/deso-python-sdk) to build new kinds of entertaining (and possbly lucrative) social agents:

1. Use the sdk to create a post from your account. Running the main properly should already achieve this. Edit the text to something more fun.
2. Use the sdk to follow @nadertheory on testnet and @nader on mainnet.
3. Use the sdk to repost something from your account. A repost uses the same submit\_post but with RepostedPostHashHex set.
4. Use the sdk to comment on someone's post. A comment is just a post with a ParentPostHash set.
5. ADVANCED: Use the sdk to write a bot that queries an AI API to automatically reply to all of your posts with something meaningful and useful.
6. ADVANCED: Use the sdk to write a bot that auto-replies to anyone who comments on your post with something meaningful from your personal account.
7. ADVANCED: Use the sdk to send a paid message to someone.
