# Write Blockchain Bots with AI

You may have noticed that the [DeSo Python SDK](https://github.com/deso-protocol/deso-python-sdk) is a single Python file. There is tremendous value in this because it means you can simply "drop" the entire sdk into your favorite AI and ask it to write new functions for you, or to put together the existing functions in novel ways. Keep this in mind as you do the other exercises in this section. It may help to load the sdk into an AI before you begin so you're ready to ask it questions!
