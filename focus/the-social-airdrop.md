# The Social Airdrop

In order to bootstrap the initial adoption of the Focus platform, $FOCUS tokens are used to incentivize influencers to join and post about Focus to their followers (and of course if they launch tokens they earn fees, as do their referrers).

With someone joins Focus and posts to their external social accounts about Focus, they get $FOCUS tokens in direct proportion to how much influence they have on these platforms. These rewards are referred to as "bounties," and anyone's reward can be quickly looked up on the [Bounty Hunter](https://focus.xyz/bounty) by entering their username on the external platform.

We plan to support X, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Twitch, select email domains, DeSo, and OnlyFans, starting with X at launch. Each network will have a slightly different reward function based on (1) the data we can collect when someone connects their account and (2) the value of user promotion on each platform.

In addition, if someone is referred by someone else, the referrer getz 10% of their joining bonus and 5% of all revenues they generate on the platform, forever. That means if you refer a significant influencer, you could get thousands of dollars up-front and potentially thousands more when they start generating income on the platform. Referring is as easy as sharing your link, and each external social account that your referee connects will earn them, and you, a separate airdrop amount based on the value of that account.

To gamify the process of discovering peoples’ account values and inviting them to Focus, we introduce a tool that will launch alongside Focus called [The Bounty Hunter](https://focus.xyz/bounty). The Bounty Hunter allows users to immediately determine the value of all of their social accounts, as well as the value of all of their followers across all of their accounts. With this information, the user can not only determine how much their reward will be for joining, but also who the most valuable users in their network are, and how much they would get if they convinced them to join. It also provides a concrete estimate of how much the user can earn from sharing their referral link to all of their followers.

Importantly, the maximum reward is only attained when a user posts on their other platforms about Focus, and leaves that post up for a sufficient amount of time (initially 24h). This makes the social airdrop effectively a bottom-up, decentralized, token-enabled form of ad-spend designed to initially bootstrap the network, and to disproportionately reward early adopters who put their reputation on the line to support the platform.

In addition, all $FOCUS tokens distributed to users as incentives are locked for one year, and vest over 4 years subsequent to their one-year “cliff,” or five years total. This ensures that all users who receive tokens are fully-aligned with the platform for the long-term.

The best part is that everyone who gets a reward becomes an owner of $FOCUS tokens, essentially making them part-owners of the platform itself. Imagine if you could get a percentage of Instagram or Twitter right when they were starting out. WIth those platforms, the early adopters got nothing, but with Focus they can get founder-level ownership just for joining and referring other users.
