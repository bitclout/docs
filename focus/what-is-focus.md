# The Crypto Social Network

Focus is a new type of social network that mixes crypto speculation and social media. It introduces new ways for creators to monetize with crypto, including next-generation token mechanics, and leverages a new crypto-native approach to virality we call the social airdrop to maximize retention and solve the cold-start problem. Focus is built from the ground up on the state-of-the-art Decentralized Social blockchain, aka [DeSo](https://deso.com).

## Introduction

**All content on-chain, controlled by your wallet.** Unlike with a traditional social network, all user content on Focus is stored directly on-chain, and end-to-end encrypted where needed, meaning nobody can ever censor your content. This means that posting, following, messaging, trading, and all social primitives are controlled solely by users’ public/private keypairs, which they automatically get when they create an account. This has the added benefit that all content is automatically digitally signed by users’ private keys, making users’ identities impossible to forge or spoof, no matter how advanced generative AI becomes. With Focus, you can finally own your content and your identity just like you own your Bitcoin.

**New ways to monetize.** On the surface, Focus looks like Twitter but with anonymous crypto-enabled monetization mechanics that include next-generation token mechanics, paid reposts (aka decentralized ads), paid messages, paid unlockable content, and subscriptions, all payable in crypto from any blockchain (including BTC, ETH, SOL, DESO, and more).

**The Feed Marketplace.** Because all accounts on Focus are also crypto wallets, Focus introduces new feed algorithms based on wallet balance that are much more resistant to bots and gaming than traditional social network signals. What’s more, thanks to the fact that all content is stored on-chain, anyone can create their own feed and list it in Focus’s Feed Marketplace, creating one of the first sustainable marketplaces for decentralized content curation.

**No company, just coins and code.** Unlike traditional social networks, where a small group of venture capitalists and shareholders capture all the value, 100% of all fees are used to buy & burn $FOCUS tokens, which anyone can buy and earn from day one. There is no equity and no for-profit corporate entity behind Focus. Tokens are purchasable and directly tradeable on the DeSo DEX, a fully decentralized on-chain order-book exchange, via [the Openfund app](https://openfund.com/trade/focus). Notably, $FOCUS tokens are also used to incentivize early adoption via a novel viral mechanic we call The Social Airdrop.\
