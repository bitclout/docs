# DESO Sinks

In addition to the natural burn from transactions, the Core Team continues to develop key applications on the DeSo Blockchain that are gaining traction, and that serve as "DeSo Sinks." We refer to these projects as such because they each have their own tokens that can only be purchased with DESO. The end result is that the success of these projects could result in vast amounts of DESO being purchased in order to gain exposure to them, independent of DESO's fee-burning potential. The largest apps that act as DeSo Sinks today are [Openfund](https://openfund.com) and [Focus](https://focus.xyz). You can see their markets on the DeSo DEX [here](https://openfund.com/trade/openfund) and [here](https://openfund.com/trade/focus).

In addition to Openfund and Focus requiring DESO in order to purchase their tokens, it is worth mentioning that Focus in particular pioneers a new kind of meme coin with a sophisticated "Automated Market-Maker" concept to power it, developed over many years. This is significant because these meme coins require FOCUS to be used and locked up in order to purchase them by default, and FOCUS can only be acquired for DESO.
