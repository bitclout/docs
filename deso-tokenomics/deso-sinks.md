# DESO Sinks

In addition to the natural burn from transactions, the Core Team continues to develop key applications on the DeSo Blockchain that are gaining traction, and that serve as "DESO Sinks." We refer to these projects as such because they each have their own toke that can only be purchased with DESO. The end result is that the success of these projects could result in vast amounts of DESO being purchased in order to gain exposure to them, independent of DESO's fee-burning potential. The largest apps that act as DESO Sinks today are [Openfund](https://openfund.com) ([docs](broken-reference)) and [Focus](https://focus.xyz) ([docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Um8ErmoE8IhgZrACSI2FeTo2yji2Q1Hxvw7KNoozM8/edit?tab=t.0)). You can see their markets on the DeSo DEX via Openfund [here](https://openfund.com/trade/openfund) and [here](https://openfund.com/trade/focus).

In addition to Openfund and Focus requiring DESO in order to purchase their tokens, it is worth mentioning that Focus in particular pioneers a new kind of token launchpad with a sophisticated "Automated Market-Maker" concept to power it, now years in the making. This is significant because the tokens launched on Focus require FOCUS tokens to be used and locked up in order to purchase them by default, and FOCUS can only be acquired for DESO.
